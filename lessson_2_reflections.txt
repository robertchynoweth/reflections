What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created as a subfolder in the folder you ran git init in. You need it so it can track revisions to you git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a tempory list of files that will be checked in with a commit. The repository is all commits overtime and the working directory is just the currect state of the folder at this moment.
