When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing work between multiple developers and when you want more than just visibility amonst your team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you don't ignore changes that might affect your work.
